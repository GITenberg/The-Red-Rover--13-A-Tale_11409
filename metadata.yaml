description: Get set for an exhilarating nautical adventure that pits one of the world's
  most notorious pirates against a ragtag crew of black and white sailors who must
  overcome their differences and band together for the fight. Although The Red Rover
  shares the fast pace and detailed plotting of Cooper's more famous books, such as
  The Last of the Mohicans, it's a more humorous take on the historical novel than
  many of his other works.
